\scriptsize To help us visualize the complex economic system, the first model is the circular-flow diagram. It includes two economic agents and two different markets in exchange for goods and services (output/product market) and for land, labor, capital (resource/factor market). To facilitate all these transactions, money is the medium of exchange and unit of account.

\scriptsize  A production possibilities frontier (PPF) measures the maximum output of two goods using a fixed amount of input. The input is any combination of production factors: natural resources, human and social capitals. The PPF is derived from the opportunity cost in production. It can illustrate economic (in)efficiency and (im)possibility.

{\small \begin{itemize}
\item While rational expectations is often thought of as a school of economic thought, it is better regarded as a ubiquitous modeling technique used widely throughout economics.
\item The rational expectations theory was first proposed by John F. Muth in the early 1960s. He used the term to describe economic situations in which the outcome depends partly on what people expect to happen. 
\item Economists who believe in rational expectations base their belief on the standard economic assumption that people behave in ways that maximize their utility or profits. Economists have used the concept to understand a variety of situations in which speculation about the future is a crucial factor in determining current action.
\item Rational expectations is a building block for the "random walk" or "efficient markets" theory of securities prices, the "overshooting" model of exchange rates, the theory of the dynamics of hyperinflations, the "permanent income" and "life-cycle" theories of consumption, and the design of economic stabilization policies.

{\small \begin{itemize}
\item Money is nonneutral. Money is defined as the commonly accepted medium of exchange. If government policy distorts the monetary unit, exchange is distorted as well. The goal of monetary policy should be to minimize these distortions.
\item The capital structure consists of heterogeneous goods that have multispecific uses that must be aligned. Production is always for an uncertain future demand, and the production process requires different stages of investment ranging from the most remote to the most immediate.
\item Social institutions often are the result of human action, but not of human design. With regard to public policy, severe doubt would be raised about the ability of government officials to intervene optimally within the economic system, let alone to rationally manage the economy.
